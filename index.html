        <p>As Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine, a crisis that has created nearly <a href="https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine"> 3 million refugees since late February</a>, the international community is showing their support for Ukraine in a multitude of ways.</p>
            
        <p>Over the weeks, many have joined in solidarity with both Ukrainians fleeing and those who have decided to remain in the country. New York City is home to one of the largest diasporic populations of Ukrainians. Support has come in different ways as well. From drag show fundraisers to restaurants donating proceeds to newly arriving refugees. There have also been protests in solidary with the country in New York City’s Times Square as well.</p>

        <p>The history between the eastern European nations is fraught with conflict. Ukraine gained independence with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. At the time of its emergence, Ukraine had been a nuclear arms giant in the region. The Budapest Memorandum called for the denuclearization of Ukraine in exchange for the guaranteed <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/budapest-memorandum-25-between-past-and-future"> “territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders.”</a></p>

                    <h3>What is the Budapest Memorandum ?</h3>
                    <p>The Budapest Memorandum  was an agreement between the U.S., the U.K., and Russia that stipulated Ukraine give up their nuclear weapons in exchange for security post Soviet collapse. All Things Considered interviewed Mariana Budjeryn, author of “Inheriting the Bomb: Soviet Collapse and Nuclear Disarmament of Ukraine” about the country’s denucleaization. </p>
                    <p>“This show of solidarity that we've recently seen, in this last kind of spur of tensions, goes a really long way to convince both Ukrainian leadership but also the public that even though we gave up these nuclear weapons, or nuclear option, the world still stands by us. And we will not face this aggression alone.”</p>

    <div class="container">
        <p>The Budapest Memorandum changed that. It called for the denuclearization of Ukraine in exchange for the guaranteed “territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders” — something protestors are calling for today.</p>

    <p>Back in Times Square, there were calls for a no-fly zone over Ukraine to protect civilians from Russian military aircraft. Amid the signs, one in particular stood out that read: “what is life when there is no peace” a question that many Ukrainians, at home and in the diaspora are wondering with no answers in sight.</p>
